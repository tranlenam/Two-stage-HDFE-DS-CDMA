## Two-stage hybrid decision feedback equalization for DS-CDMA systems

This repo is cloned from [this CodeOcean capsule](https://codeocean.com/capsule/5006509/tree/v1), which contains the simulation code for the following paper:

Le-Nam Tran, Een-Kee Hong, and Huaping Liu, "Two-Stage Hybrid Decision Feedback Equalization for DS-CDMA Systems," IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol.7, no.5, pp. 1490-1494, May 2008. 

## Instructions
**CDMA_HDFE_UW_BitLevel_Softdecision_Main.m** plots the BER as a function of EbNo for the proposed HDF.
